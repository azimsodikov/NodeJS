/**
 * * NPM: Node Package Manager
 * * Package Managment System: 
 * * Software that automates installing and updating packages. Deals with what version you have or need, and manages dependencies.
 * * Dependency: 
 * * Code that another set of code depends on to function. If you use that code in your app, it is a dependency. Your app depends on it.
 * * Semantic Versioning: 
 * * Specifying what version of a set of code this is.. So others can track if a new version has come out. This allows to watch for new features
 * * or to watch for 'breaking changes'.
 * * The word 'semantic' implies that something conveys meaning. 
 * ! MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH ex: 1.7.2
 * * Patch release: Some bugs were fixed. Your code will work fine
 * * Minor release: Some new features were added. Your code will work fine.
 * * Major release: Big changes. Your code will break (maybe).
 * 
 * * Npm and the Npm registery: Other People's code
